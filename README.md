# HypeBanDB-API

## How To Install To HypeBanDB (I won't support others, figure it out skid):
* Download the `api.js` and `externalLoader.js` files
* Drop the `api.js` file into the `util` folder
* Simply replace your `externalLoader.js` with the one you downloaded (If you don't have one make sure you get the most updated version of the Ban DB from https://hyperz.dev)
* Start the bot as usual and enjoy the API
